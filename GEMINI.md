# Project: openapi-mcp

## Current Task
The user wants to create an MCP (Model Context Protocol) from the OpenAPI specification located at `./specs/miadi-250509-narrativegroup-agent_.yml`.

## Plan
1. Confirm the existence and content of the specified YAML file.
2. Determine the appropriate command or process to create an MCP from an OpenAPI specification within this project.
3. Execute the MCP creation.
4. Verify the successful creation of the MCP.

## Update
The MCP has been successfully created from `./specs/miadi-250509-narrativegroup-agent_.yml`. The `openapi-mcp` server is running and serving over stdio. Verification was performed by running `bin/openapi-mcp --dry-run ./specs/miadi-250509-narrativegroup-agent_.yml`, which successfully outputted the JSON representation of the generated tools.
